# Mini-Adventure

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
I am going to build anything that I can come up with using the 3D printer. The 3D printer can print anything that 
you can think of and make. I am excited to build all the things that I will because each would be its own struggle 
and threw out this I will learn what works and what doesn’t. Each 3D print having its own “adventure” when being created.

## Plan

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
There are many different steps that can be taken to create 3D prints. The simplest being: (1) downloading a print, 
(2) setting up the 3D printer, (3) putting the file into the 3D printer, and then (4) waiting and seeing the final piece. 
The other steps that you can take would be the same as the last except you could use Solidworks and make your own 3D model to print out.


## Budget

What materials will you need for your project? Where will you get them? How much does it cost? 
Please include all materials, including components you already own. Make sure to factor in shipping costs and sales tax.

The materials that I will need would be a 3D printer and filament. I will get the materials from Amazon.
